Senior Project Web-App

## 1. download npm feature (node package manager) 
We need to install node js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
After downloading you can check if u have NPM installed by typing npm --version in command prompt.

## 2. pull from github
Clone my github repository : https://github.com/vthanhnguyen/seniorproject

## 3. download node modules
After cloning the repository, open up the terminal and type: 
npx create-react-app .
The purpose of this is just to get the "node_modules" folder

## 4. Run the web-app
Type the command in VScode terminal: npm start
A web page will open and show what we have.
